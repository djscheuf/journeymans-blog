###### Issue 03

This Issue's Highlight
----------------------

**[A Man's Letter to his daughter about young men](https://medium.com/@benjaminsledge/a-letter-to-my-daughter-about-young-men-2bab2fca4971#.i4oever3u)** \- I cannot even begin to describe the affect this article had on me when I first read it. I strongly recommend it. It is thought-provoking, and emotionally challenging. It touched something in me, and it forced me to pause during my day and reflect. One of the more powerful quotes from the post: "**Meekness is strength wrapped in humility, my dear daughter. It is strength under control in a world where so many are _out of control." _**I encourage you to read, and to have this experience as well! **[A Guide on How To Read](http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf)** \- On a more practical note, this is a small booklet from the University of Michigan School of Information. It was intended to help Grad students learn to read vast volumes of information. Personally I wished that I had found during my undergraduate degree. It would have helped with the engineering textbooks.

The Goods
---------

[**On Naming Languages, or Con-Langs**](http://mewo2.com/notes/naming-language/) \- All-Hail the inner nerd! This article is a very nice walk-through for creating a naming language. In this particular context, the author was creating a Name generator for a role-playing world. He wanted the names to sound reasonable, and so walks through the various rules and complexities of a language. It's a very enjoyable read! [**On reasonable world Terrain**](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/) \- Another post by the author of the Con-Lang article. This one focuses on reasonably generating a worlds terrain. Discussions of reasonable height-maps, erosion, and even city-placement. He even discusses the appropriate power of 2 to use when generating the height map. Again an interesting article. **[A short evangilization of soldering](https://medium.com/@ecaron/why-i-stopped-hacking-the-amazon-dash-button-and-learned-to-solder-84386a38bbd1#.m28puy323) **\- A short articlefrom a Maker who learned the need to solder. Because his child's nightlight, previously powered by a Amazon button, burned out. I hope you enjoy the read! **[A discussion of common pitfall with Microservices](https://blog.codeship.com/5-ways-not-mess-microservices-production/)** \- This is kind of a sponsored article ( not that I am paid, but that the author is kind of pushing a particular solution). However ti does offer some interesting discussion, and especially for a neophyte to Microservices, I found that discussion informative. Generally the pitfalls that he mentions are distributed logging, the difficult of debugging in a distributed environment, and cascade failures when a system dependency fails. **[An off-the-grid office](https://syonyk.blogspot.com/2016/07/solar-shed-summary-my-off-grid-office.html) [space](https://syonyk.blogspot.com/2016/07/solar-shed-summary-my-off-grid-office.html)** \- This guy build a little shed in his back-yard into an off-the-grid work-space. I personally think it's pretty cool, particularly for the off-the-grid part. I also think said office would be a bit hot, but still a cool idea. **[A software engineers hack of business negotiations](https://medium.com/@cramforce/hacking-business-negotiations-117468bc51e7#.f3euo1944)** \- Now as a disclaimer, I cannot vouch for the recommended sales tactic. But in a conceptual sense, the author of this article has some good points. He describes a method to build the trust of prospective clients, in a way that only an engineering mind could be comfortable with.  

### This Issue's Curiosity

**[An Anti-mediocrity Manifesto](http://gabordemooij.com/index.php?p=/manifest)** \- An interesting idea for software developers. It's something like the Agile manifesto or the Reactive Manifesto, but focuses instead on keeping the developer from slipping into mediocre patterns. **[The thorny relationship between Science and Philosophy](http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/07/the-basics-of-the-thorny-relationship-between-science-and-philosophy/)** \- This article from Ars Technica, focuses on , as the title suggests the relationship between philosophy and science. At it's root it is about how we know what we know, and whether we can trust that knowledge.
