[Strength rises from the dichotomy](/2023/09/26/organization-strength) of rigidity, and flexibility. [Agility](/2023/09/19/agile-organism), emerges form the application of strength in coordinated action. Each member pushing or pulling in the right sequence. Organism and organization need discipline to make the applied strength effective. This discipline deals with the ability of the organism to pursue it's goal with the available strength. The gymnast uses it to launch themselves into the air, catch themselves, and turn into a twirl. A business uses it to align their work streams to rapidly deliver their product to market. But without the discipline the gymnast's twirl is thrown off balance through wasted movement. Meanwhile the business' project falls into ineffective bloat; over time and over budget. Strength becomes agility only through coordinated action towards the goal. It takes discipline to stop doing what is unnecessary for the goal, and avoid wasting strength.
