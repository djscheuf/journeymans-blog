Howdy all! 

I just wanted to take a quick moment to share some exciting news: I am launching my latest book ['10 Days to Greater Agility'](https://leanpub.com/10days-agile) on [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/)!

Designed around the classic Scrum sprint, this 10-Day Challenge provides interested technologists, and agilists with approachable actions to start owning their practice of the agile mindset. Each day is designed to allow you to grow in small steps taking 15-30 minutes a day, ideal for working it into a busy work schedule.

Not all growth is created equal. Practice trumps lecture, especially for the agile mindset! To practice a mindset, you must practice thinking in that mindset. This challenge explores the trade-offs highlighted in the Agile Manifesto, book-ended by the Scrum pillars of Inspection and Adaptation. How far can you get in 10 Days?

Thanks for joining me on this step in the journey! I look forward to having more to share in the future!
