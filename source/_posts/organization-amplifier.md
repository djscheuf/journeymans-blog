description: Organizations are an odd apparatus. They're not concrete like people... so what exactly are they?
---
Organizations are an odd apparatus. It is not a concrete thing in the same way the people who compose it are. Moreover the Organization is also distinct from the processes, or programming, it houses. [One great thinker](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459) even described Organizations being the same as a [Mathematical Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)). Yet... Why do we still make so much use of Organizations?

It is because Organizations are [Amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier). They are a means to take the vision and efforts of a handful of people and multiply their return. One can change the world with as few at 12 people. They only need be properly and effectively aligned to amplify one another's efforts.
