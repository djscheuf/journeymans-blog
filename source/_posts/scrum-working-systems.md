description: Gall's Law says working complex systems evolve from simple working systems, you cannot start with a complex system. So when we pursue an agile transformation, is applying Scrum a Complex working system or is it introducing a simple working system?

Have you ever heard of [Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Galls_law)? It's a quote from [John Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author))'s book [_Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail_](https://www.amazon.com/Systemantics-Systems-Work-Especially-They/dp/0812906748) :
> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

I touched on the [atomicity of Scrum](/2023/10/17/scrum-is-atomic) previously. But this Law bring up a worthy question for agile practitioners. Often during an Agile Transformation, we start with a full Scrum implementation. But is starting that way trying to start with a complex system? Or is it introducing a new simple working system?
