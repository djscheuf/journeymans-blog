A little under a month ago, I spoke at Houston TechFest 2020, the Virtual Edition! I am always surprised how many people make it out, and this year was no exception. We had some excellent questions and good engagement in the sessions I was part of, and I wanted to thank all who attended!

I'm still trying to figure out how/if I can post my slide decks, but in lo of that, I have collected the links to the Recordings and the various extra resources I mentioned in my presentations! If you missed the sessions, check them out! There something useful in each ðŸ™‚
