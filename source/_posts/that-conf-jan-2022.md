I am excited to announce that I have been selected to be a 'Camp Councilor' for THAT Conference this coming January! I'll be joining as part of their Hybrid conference this year, delivering 3 online talks:

## Code is Read
 > Jan 18, 2022 10:30-11:30AM CST

What separates the highly-skilled developer from the one fresh out of college? Why is it that some developer's code is far easier to maintain and others are nearly impossible to decipher? Both boil down fundamentally to whether you can easily understand the ideas and intent conveyed in their code. So what makes for easily understood code?

There are some communication principles we can apply to our code to make it cheaper to change, and faster to understand. After all Code is read more often than it is written. It ought to be easy to read! [Find the talk here.](https://that.us/activities/5QtytPYDEEXqwikhcV9V)

## Own Your Career
 > Jan 19, 2022 10:30-11:30AM CST 

Have you been hustling? Maybe you just got the promotion and now you don't know what to do? Career development is a odd road. Sometimes you need to dive deep, others you need to venture wide. But there is a method to the madness. And it boils down to what stage your in? You're either in Do, Know, or Grow, and each has a different flavor and tendency. Come explore what it takes to build your career no matter the stage! [Find the talk here.](https://that.us/activities/ueXqcmNkYUJ9FdEFOdh2)

## Helping your Waterfall flow Faster
 > Jan 20, 2022 10:30-11:30AM CST

A perfect world _might_ be agile. But what do you do with reality? What can you do against the immense inertia of a well-worn Waterfall Culture? Platitudes aren't enough! Failed agile transformations are proof of that. The change must be deeper. It must be actions. But who can do this?!

You can. In fact, if you see the need, you are in the single best position to make the change! You can demonstrate or derive the principles of agility right before their very eyes! It isn't an easy road, but let me show you how you can start! Are you willing to try? [Find the talk here.](https://that.us/activities/yHiQiIymPUw8rZbMp7xl)
