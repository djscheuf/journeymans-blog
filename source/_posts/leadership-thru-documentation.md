description: Key to a leader's effectiveness is their ability to work through others. So how do you do that?

While reading through [The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459) by Drucker, I happened upon an interesting quote:
> A well-managed factory is boring. Nothing exciting happens in it because the crises have been anticipated and have been converted into routine.

How does a Leader convert crisis into routine? By taking their experience, and knowledge, they write a process, and decision making principles. I touched on this in [my podcast episode, Leadership is about Systems](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/journeymans-travels/episodes/Leadership-is-about-Systems-e21mt46). But putting it another way, and building on [last weeks post](/2023/06/05/organizing-effective-docs/), writing effective process or instructional documentation is a form of Leadership. You make your experience accessible to your team. And you enable them to convert a crisis into routine, in part, by using the systematized practices you learned through use.
