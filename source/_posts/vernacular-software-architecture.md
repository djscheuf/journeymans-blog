description: Local Environments act on architecture to produce a vernacular. What environments influence the vernacular for software architecture?
---

I've recently developed an interest in physical Architecture, and especially in vernacular architecture! Vernacular architecture is like the common architectural language of a place. The vernacular designs are emergent solutions to common challenges applied in different contexts. Think "how does someone solve 'Housing' when Wood is in short supply? Or when it snows heavily in winter?" These designs often perform better in their own environments than more generic solutions can. That disparity got me thinking. What might a vernacular _software_ architecture look like? Per [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), organizations build software the mirrors their own structure. So organizational structure is the context influencing vernacular software architecture! Now suppose I were looking for solution patterns. I should look for organizations with a similar, or used to be similar, structure to mine! Their vernacular solutions would offer more insight to my challenges! The only question that remains is: what hallmarks to look for to find similar organizations?
