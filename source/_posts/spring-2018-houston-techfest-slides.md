I am pleased to say that my presentation on May 5th at the Spring 2018 Houston TechFest went very well. Being my first conference presentation I was a bit nervous but I enjoyed the experience very much. For those who kindly attended my session _'Demystifying the Whiteboard Interview'_, I thank you. As promised, I have uploaded the slides [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LV0l4YklGICI3ZD7oJWgqx3ebyGiEcg4). If you would kindly leave a rating at [SpeakerRate](http://spkr8.com/t/75481), I would be most appreciative. I look forward to seeing you all at the Fall Houston TechFest!
