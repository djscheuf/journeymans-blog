description: I recently found and read Daniel Pink's The Adventures of Johnny Bunko. You might not think a Manga would be a good business book read, but it was! Let me tell you about it!

It's not often that I am surprised by how good a 'recommendation' from my shopping app is. Today though I get to share one! I was familiar with [Daniel Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink) from [To Sell is Human](https://www.amazon.com/Sell-Human-Surprising-Persuading-Influencing/dp/1786891719/), but when I saw a Manga with his name on it, I was honestly confused. I thought it was a spoof. But nope! It's legit. And the contents were top quality; art, story, and all! [The Adventures of Johnny Bunko](https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Johnny-Bunko-Career-Guide/dp/1594482918/) sells itself as "The Last Career Guide You'll Ever Need". And it lives up to that claim.

If I had to summarize the book in a few sentences, here's what I'd try to pitch:
- Johnny Bunko, an accountant as Boggs, feel stuck in his job, when a magic Chopstick Fairy offers to advise him.
- Through a series of challenges, and misadventures, Bunko learns 6 critical rules to find his way into a fulfilling career
- Those rules are: (better if you read the book!)
	... 
	5. Make _excellent_ mistakes. 
   ...

Its good book for anyone looking to clarify their thinking about their career, regardless of their present level of success. It won't sell you on any silliness about 'just follow your dreams' or any of that. The book focuses on expounding the key 'rules' in relatable situations and faux pas. The protagonist essentially lives through situations that help us realize the real nature of the rules.

There were two particularly useful pieces for me. The first, was the rule I shared earlier: "Make Excellent Mistakes". Not all mistakes are created equal. Some mistakes fail, but fail while still trying after the right principle. You can build on these, if you take time to learn from the mistakes. Other mistakes aren't so excellent. They emerge from hedging your bets, or under-utilizing strengths. Don't make those.

The second element was an extension on the model for 'reasons why you do something'. Specifically are you doing for _instrumental_ or _fundamental_ reasons? You can work a Job for _instrumental_ reasons, that is because you think it will lead to something else. Such a job keeps you from really pursuing excellence in the things that matter. That language, instrumental vs. fundamental, helped me clarify my own thinking!

I recommend this book. Bizarre as it might be to recommend a Manga as a Business book, it works, and you've gotta try it! It's a quick read, and even if you don't need it right now, you'll be happy to have met the Chopstick Fairy soon enough! I'll leave you with my favorite quote from later in the book:
> It's about your **customer**. It's about your **client**. Use your **strengths**, yes. But **remember** you're here to **serve** -- not self-actualize. 
> - Diana, the Chopstick Fairy, The Adventures of Johnny Bunko
