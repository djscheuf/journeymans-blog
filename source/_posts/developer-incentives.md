description: Perverse Incentives misalign reward and desired result. What would it look like to better align developer's incentives with the results of their products?

You call an incentive that rewards the opposite of its intent a [perverse incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive). Rewarding QAs by the number of bugs submitted and Developers for the absence of bugs in their code might be one. In sales, you offer a [commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_(remuneration)) on the sale. This aligns the incentives of the employee with the organization. I have yet to hear of an organization that rewards its developers based on the success of the product they produce. Most just reward performing a set of prescribed behaviors. What it might look like to 'align the incentives of' a developer with those of the organization they serve?
