I know I'll get a '*Captain Obvious*' Award for this, but GenAI is here to stay. That doesn't make it an encouraging statement. There's still some fear-mongering about how AI will 'eliminate' whole classes of work. And this is true in part. For example, AI will compete with outsourcing for companies looking for cheap code-mills. [*'Fear is the mind-killer.'*](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3634639-dune) Take a pause to think about your situation as it really is. If you chief contribution is code-gen, then yeah, AI might be a competitor... if it knew what code to generate. 

I've alluded to some of the opportunity that GenAI brings. [AI won't transform your organization](./blog/ai-wont-transform/), but you could. The trick will be learning to effectively use this new tool. GenAI is a computer. They're great at following specific instructions very quickly. You're human, great as sifting down complexity into concrete actions you can do. Take a hard look at the steps of your work. GenAI can help speed up some of those steps, but not all.

Think of GenAI like next-gen Software Engineering Power Tools, like the IDE, or Containers. Just like the [work of carpenters evolved with electrification](./blog/ai-software-future/) , so will your job.  And the best way to avoid  a wave crushing you, is to ride atop it. Therefore, learn to leverage GenAI. I'm doing the same personally. Here's some of what I've learned to help you get started. 

You have to ***ROCC It***: 
- R - **Role** - You are an expert in C#, and SQL Database Design.
- O - **Objective** - Help the user design, and stub out a REST API, and basic Database Access Methods. Ask the User clarifying questions to help them refine the design. Ask for additional instructions if you cannot infer what you should do next.
- C - **Context** -  You will be designing an API for integrating with an Ecommerce Application. Your database will store User Preferences, for notifications, sales, and product suggestions. Here's an example {feature or story} this domain will support: {Given-When-Then feature example}
- C - **Constraints** - Your Domain only contains Preferences. Use Externally Provided User Identities. Favor the Read operations over Write for Performance. Use an Eventual Compliance pattern. 

A Couple more notes:
- Remember that your AI is an over-eager, well-informed, but somewhat unskilled Junior. Collaborate with it bearing those constraints in mind. 
- Also GenAI, like toddlers don't understand NOT, so do NOT tell it what NOT to do. Put your Constraints in the form of "DO X", or "Only use Y".
