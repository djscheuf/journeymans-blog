I took some time this week to review my resolutions/goals from last  year. I was trying to see what I could learn and what I could improve.  While I did succeed in all my goals, I learned a couple things that  might be useful if shared.

To being with 2 of  my 3 year-long goals focused on relationship growth, one for family and  more of church. And both these goals suffered from a similar problem. I  phrased the goal in a vague manner. And in particular I phrased in such a  way that any growth in the category could have marked as success.

But  In reviewing the goal, I realize I had a particular end in mind for  both goals, that was not stated. Further, I found that I had written  them this way to 'hedge my bets'. That is I left success vague so I  could avoid the feeling for 'failure' if I missed the mark. A little  silly, but something I should correct.

This  year, I learned some new models to help frame, discuss and describe  relationships. I have the tools to describe my goals better. But  moreover I begin to understand why I feared expressing my true goals.

So  this year, I plan to write my goals stating my actual ambition. Even if  it is frighteningly beyond my current capabilities . To combat this, I  will be writing up sub-goals, with something akin to the [SMART template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).  I'll be listing out smaller deliverable to help bridge the gap between  the now and the future I am aiming for. The deliverable will usually be  per Quarter, with a Specific Target to 'succeed'.

These  Quarterly goals I can then review and allocate time specifically to  meet them. Last year, I had the goals written down and reviewed them  about 3 times including the review I did this week. I am hoping to keep  my activity more focused by having more frequent review.

In  this season of Reflection, I hope that hearing how I shy-ed away from  my truly hopeful Future, and how I plan to get closer next year will  encourage you to do the same. Seek the goals which kindle your passion,  and don't hedge your bets!
