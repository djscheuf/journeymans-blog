**1 Big Thing:** Only 9% keep their Resolutions; pick the _right_ resolutions, and you can beat those odds!

**Context**
- [Only 9% of Americans](https://fisher.osu.edu/blogs/leadreadtoday/why-most-new-years-resolutions-fail) report keeping their resolutions by the end of the Year
- Many quit within 2 weeks!
- Identity Resolutions are stickier than 'Goal' Resolutions.

**Why it Matters**
- Resolutions are about growth, and a 91% drop rate means we're stagnating!
- The early fall off means we're picking resolutions and systems poorly!

**Now What**
You can beat these odds with a few simple, though not easy, actions:
1. Pick Resolutions that align with who you are, or who you wish to be! Fundamental like *'I will be a healthier person'*, NOT Instrumental like *'Lose 20 lbs so I can XYZ'*.
2. Take Small Steps, and build systems! Not *'Lose 20 lbs in 90 Days'*, but *'Walk 50 more steps every day this week'*.
3. Get Accountability! Tell someone who will check up on you regularly!

**Dive Deeper**
- I first heard the Fundamental/Instrumental dichotomy in [The Adventures of Johnny Bunko](/2024/10/07/book-review-johnny-bunko/)
- Check out James Clear's [Atomic Habits](), and esp. his thoughts on [Identity-based Habits](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits)
- I'm using [Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/home) with my wife to help with my accountability this year!
