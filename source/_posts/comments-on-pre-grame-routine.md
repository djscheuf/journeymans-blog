_This post references, and reproduces one which first appeared on [lassala.net](https://lassala.net/2018/12/06/pre-game-routine-to-write-code/). I reproduce it in part here with the Author's permission and blessing. I encourage all to check out [Claudio's blog](lassala.net) for more great content!_

>'I’ve first heard of having a “pre-game routine” in [this post](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-get-motivated) by James Clear, and have used to technique a couple of times. This week, I’ve decided to try it out as a “code writing warm-up”. 🙂

>The idea is to write a little bit of code for a couple of minutes just to get my mind in that mode. I also decided to stack pair this new habit with either learning or getting better at something I see room for improvement. In my case, that’s ES6.'

He goes on to reference [RubyKoans](https://rubykoans.com/) and a [collection of ES6 katas](https://es6katas.org/). And since we work together I've had the chance to watch him do these 5-10 minute katas a handful of times.

As I read the post I remembered a handful of exercises I've used to improve my skills. In particular, I implemented examples of the [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) [Design Patterns in Python](https://github.com/djscheuf/ProgamingPractice/tree/GangOfFour). I spent a little time here and there over the course of a month to complete my task. I walked through each put in place an example. I learned a great deal from implementing the patterns. And my designs improved . The first-hand knowledge that implementing each pattern provided has been very valuable.

I'd like to offer one last idea. /in support of Claudio's original point, I recommend the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018), which I  found last year. They post a new exercise each day of the Advent calendar. They've already started but you can still take part as they keep a list of their activities!
