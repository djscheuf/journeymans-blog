description: Key to a leader's effectiveness is their ability to work through others. So how do you do that?
---
Key to a leader's effectiveness is their ability to work through others. Most often this takes the form of empowerment or delegation. But if you hand out 100 tasks, only to get 100 decisions you have to review back... you're not actually making the organization more productive!

Instead, think about enabling decisions when you're not in the room. This is effective delegation. It requires a shared understanding of what is important, and how to measure it. [Clear communication](./2019/05/06/improve-your-clarity-of-communication/) then is a prerequisite to effective delegation. The book [Measure What Matters](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221) has great insights on this topic. And these insights are applicable for leading both up and down the ladder!
