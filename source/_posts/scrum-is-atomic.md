description: Scrum-But is a common anti-pattern. But can the result to subtracting parts from the whole of Scrum still be called Scrum?
---

_Scrum-But_ is a common anti-pattern in agile practice. The core question is whether you can remove anything from the prescribed actions in the Scrum Guide. And whether what remains is still Scrum. Per the [Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#end-note):
> While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum.

So, there is no Kinda-Scrum. Only _Scrum_ and _Not-Scrum_. There is a good word to describe the inseparability of the set of Scrum practices. 'Atomic' from the Greek `atomos` meaning uncuttable, or inseparable. Scrum in it's entirety is one inseparable whole.
