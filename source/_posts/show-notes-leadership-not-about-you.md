# Leadership is NOT about you
Aired on [*A Journeyman's Travels* Podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/journeymans-travels) on April 14, 2023
These are the notes from which I recorded the show. They're a little unpolished since the original audience was just me. But I've added some of the reference material that I allude to in the podcast and post it here, should anyone want to 'see how the sausage is made'. 

## Show Notes
### Introduction
### Leadership is not title or position. Leadership is influence
- There is a cultural confusions at play. Management != Leadership
- And there is a growing awareness, so the statement that Leadership is not a title, but something else is not new.
- But it does mean that leadership is not really _just_ bequeathed on someone by an eternal force. Not _just_
	- Certainly someone can receive a role where they are expected to lead and given a group they are expect toi lead. But that won't magically make them a leader. 
- Rather their ability to lead, to guide and improve the actions of others comes from their ability to influence ideas and behaviors. Leadership is influence. 
- See Definitions: 
	- To Manage - To have charge of; direct or administer; To exert control over; To direct or supervise
	- To Lead - To show the way to by going in advance; To guide or direct in a course; To inspire the conduct of
### Leader without followers is just a man out for a walk - Maxwell
- "They don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care" - Maxwell
- Critical question for a leaders self-reflection: am I someone others want to follow?
- Golden Rule - would I want to follow me? (alt. someone who behaved like I do?)
### Leadership is about the people you lead, and making them more effective
- Leadership is a new skill. It's not about doing more of what you once did as an Individual contributor.
- It is about how you can bring those who follow you to produce more effectively or impactfully. 
- It is thus about seeing where the future might lead, and preparing people to act in way which help bring that about.
- A classic example of this is in training. Often the new leader is one who was skilled at the role he is not expected to lead. 
	- It is tempting to do the work.
	- But consider: the impact of a leader enabling the team or optimizing the work to be done, focusing on most value.
