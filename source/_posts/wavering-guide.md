Have you ever tried to follow someone to a new destination? As a follower, it becomes very clear, very quick if the one you are following doesn't know the way either! It is quite difficult to follow a wavering guide, and the same applies in our organizations. So then, how is a leader supposed to adapt to change, without being a wavering guide? It involved extending greater trust to your teams. You cannot stop at teaching them the behaviors, the *'what'* to do. You must also teach them the principles leading you to that action, the *'why'* you do it. Now when a better *'what'* for pursuing that *'why'* appears, you are free to adapt. The team will already know where you are headed. When you start marching on a different heading, they can march with you confidently. They'll know the goal, and how you're connecting their steps right now to it.
