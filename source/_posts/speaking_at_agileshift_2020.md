I found out this weekend, that I've been selected to speak at Houston's Second [AgileShift conference](https://theagileshift.com/)! This year it'll be on June 5th.

After its successful debut in 2019, the conference is back in 2020, bigger and better. I am eager to present this year, and I heard great things about the event last year from several other speakers! I canâ€™t wait to see the community coome together to learn, to network, and as speakers, sharing their experiences! 

Now the final roster hasn't been announced yet, but should be available in the next few days. If you'd like to see the kind of topics that were covered last year, you can check out the [schedule page from 2019](https://theagileshift.com/Archive/Houston/2019/schedule.html).

Before you go, I want to let you know that [Early Bird pricing](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/agileshift-2020-tickets-86812794405) is still going one! But the last day for that is February 29th!
