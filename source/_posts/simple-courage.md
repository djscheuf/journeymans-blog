Leadership certainly requires courage, but perhaps not in the way we traditionally think. There are clear and obvious moments when a leader must have courage under fire. But few of us face such stark moments calling for our last full measure. God bless those who are called and who answered. For the rest of us, the challenge is to face our limitations daily, and yet still lead. It is the [courage](/2020/02/10/form_of_every_vitrue/) to say 'I don't know, but let's try', and perhaps then later to say 'I was wrong. Here's how. Now let us try anew'.

Simple, daily humility. To know you've made mistakes, and that you'll make yet more. Simple daily courage. To get up, shake it off, and try anyway. This is a courage anyone can practice and leaders must master.
