description: I'm writing a new book, and thought it'd be fun to share my research notes on what makes an effective introduction!
---
I'm working on a new book! As part of preparing to write a better introduction, I thought it wise to review what other author's had done. So I re-read and analyzed the introductions from:
- [Effective Executive](fxv-exec)
- [Mere Christianity](mere-christ)
- [Leadership Strategy and Tactics](strat-and-tactic)
- and [Make It Stick](make-stick)

All four seemed to follow a consistent pattern of:
- Introducing the main problem/challenge or whatever incited the author to write the book
- Then the author often will introduce themselves, and explain what the book will be, and what it will not be.
- Finally they prepare the reader for the Author's style. And they lay out expectations for the work that follows.

Jocko Willink, [Leadership Strategy and Tactics](strat-and-tactic), favors a story-heavy introduction. This matches how he covers the ideas in the rest of the book. Meanwhile C.S. Lewis explains that [Mere Christianity](mere-christ) was originally a radio broadcast. He highlights how he has updated or edited the drafts to better suit the printed instead of the spoken word. But by far my favorite patter comes from Peter Drucker in [Effective Executive](fxv-exec).

Here, Drucker seems bent of giving you value from the very first page. His Introduction covers the main thesis of his book. Then it proceeds to walk through every main takeaway from each of the chapters within the book! Yet his introduction does not prove that the Effective Executive could have been an short essay either! Instead, Drucker deftly crafts his introduction to give you actionable insights from the page one. At the same time, he points to the deeper exploration needed in each area covered. I will admit that is a pattern I find admirable, and one I hope to emulate in time.
