You're leaving an opportunity on the table every sprint. And you're probably not even aware it's there! Remember, the business doesn't want code. They want the business effect the code produces.
Here's the thing: The business side doesn't typically _know_ technology. They depend on you to bring that insight.

But are you bringing _insight_? Or are you following orders? What did you present during the last Spring Demo? Certainly the technical complexity of the work you did this sprint is fascinating... to the right audience. But are you alive to the possibilities the tech offers your business?

The Sales Executive Council did a sweeping survey. Across many industries, company sizes, and solution types, a pattern emerged. [Customers most valued sales reps who delivered new insights and drive new ways of thinking](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/power-challenger-sales-model). It made them a thought-partner, not just an order-taker or a slimy sales guy. We can apply that lesson too.

A Development team has unique insight into current and possible technologies. We just need to gather insight on the way the business does business. Then while we demo, we can share the insights and possibilities we're seeing.

And in so doing, create the next opportunity for success!
