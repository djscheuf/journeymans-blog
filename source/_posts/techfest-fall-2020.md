With all the craziness 2020 has, It is nice to get to talk about a good thing that's still going. Houston TechFest is still happening this year! Instead of the usual conference, the show has gone digital!

All the great speakers and topics you've come to expect are still there, but this time from the comfort of your home office! It is my very good pleasure to say that two of my talk was selected for this year's edition.

This year, my topics are:

## Own your Career

Have you been hustling? Maybe you just got the promotion and now you don't know what to do? Or maybe fate dealt you a ‘mandatory pivot’ card? Either way Career development is an odd road. Sometimes you need to dive deep, at others you need to venture wide. But there is a method to the madness. And it boils down to what stage you’re in? You're either in Do, Know, or Grow, and each has a different flavor and tendency. Come explore what it takes to build your career no matter the stage!

## Facilitating Engaging Retros

The Sprint Retro is an opportunity for the Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements. But the Retro is only as useful as the feedback from the team. If the team isn't engaged, how can a Retro succeed? Let's chat about the purpose for Retros, and how we can use that the reignite interest in this agility critical meeting! We'll also talk about some tool and experiments you can try in your Retro to help your team _own_ their process! Come learn how to Facilitate Engaging Retros!
