description: A good model can be a powerful reasoning tool! But is software as a product the most useful model for organizations where software isn't the main thing?
---

A good model can be a powerful reasoning tool. Now [all models are wrong, but some are useful](./2019/12/09/models-are-not-reality/). Much of the literature about building great software applies the 'software as a product' model. It is a good model, but less useful for organizations where software isn't the main thing. Instead, thinking of software as a tool, akin to large industrial machinery, or better yet a road would prove a more valuable model. This model encourages one to consider more questions like:
- Where does the road go? How easy is to add another destination?
- Is the road valuable if no one uses it? How many have to use it before it is?
- How much does it does for small car to use the road? How much for a massive, heavy commercial truck?
- How might that car or truck 'pay' that cost?
- What kind of maintenance does the road need every year to remain passable?
