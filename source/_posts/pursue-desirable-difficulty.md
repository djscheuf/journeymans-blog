Recently I got a new laptop, and was trying to setup Windows 11 on it. After some trouble and frustrations with Windows I opted for a VM. But it needed Secureboot and BitLocker to get on my company network. I've never done that before on a VM, but decided to try anyway.
While I didn't _know_ I could accomplish the goal, I had the sense that it was within reach, if rather a stretch.
Through the process of struggling with the VM, I experience an interesting development.

I learned a lot about SecureBoot, how it works, and even why it was created. Further I learned about the limitation of my OS, and even the Virtualization software I was using. These difficulties turned out to be desirable!

Not only did they create the need for me to learn, but also made the learning more durable.
Not every difficulty may be desirable. But pursuing these challenges creates more opportunities to learn and grow.

I first encountered the concept of 'Desireable Difficulty' in [Make It Stick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674729013/), the Science of Learning.
If you're curious, you can learn more about [Secureboot here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Secure_Boot).
As for my particular challenge, I think [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/qd7rg6/difficulties_with_libvirt_qemu_hooks_ovmf_secboot/?rdt=35945) captures it well.
