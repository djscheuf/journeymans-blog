description: Do you know your DISC? How does yours impact how you apply the Trust Behaviors?

Do you know your [DISC](https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/)? How does yours impact how you apply the [Trust Behaviors](https://resources.franklincovey.com/the-speed-of-trust/the-13-behaviors-of-high-trust)? For example, I am incredibly comfortable with 'Confront Reality' conversations... but I am also a High D. In fact, because it is so easy for me, I can wrongly expect others on my team to freely engage in these kinds of healthy conflict with me. And it can be very disappointing when they do not, or else later voice that it makes them uncomfortable. If I had known their DISC was High S, I might have taken a different approach, as High S do not thrive on conflict. So... do you know your Team's DISCs? How do they affect how your Team expresses the Trust Behaviors?
