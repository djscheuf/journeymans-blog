I write a lot on software testing. One of the rules of thumb I use is "0-1-N". It which helps me remember the 3 common cases I'd need to test for any list based operation. But I recently started applying it to organizational design questions, in the form of 'What would this {process, principles, idea} look like applied at the 0,1 and N levels?'. The 0 level would be as an Individual ( i.e. 2^0 people involved.) Systems like Scrum exist at the 2^1 level. They guide a team, usually in the context of a wider organization. But Scrum does not _need_ to run at the 2^N to be effective. But by contrast, Scrum could be cumbersome for a 2^0 level.

This application becomes really useful when it challenges your understanding. It forces you to ask how good ideas at the Individual level must transform as they scale out. Consider scaling a business down to the 0th level. We'd effectively talking about a independent contractor. A single player has to perform all the key business practices! Which ones get kept? What priorities or principles are the dividing line? What is "only useful at scale", and what is "vital at every stage"?

Try it out by examining agile work processes. What principles inform individual actions? What do those look like at the 1st level, that is, for a team? Then look at the Nth Level, the organization, how are we performing at the "Vital at every stage" as an organization?
