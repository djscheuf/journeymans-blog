Have you ever discovered documentation answers somewhere you'd never look? After a recent occurrence, I asked myself why that was. My answer was in a section about that page of the website. As a Developer, that matches how I would have created the documentation myself. It was not in a section related to the workflow, or job, I was trying to do. But that is where I , as a user, would be looking for it. Put another way, the documentation had a *'surprising'* user experience. If we consider Documentation as a separate, but related product, we gain some UX insights. This Information Product can, and should benefit from the ideas we use in Software Development every sprint. Tools like ['Jobs to be Done'](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done), and ['User Personas'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)) give us a boost. But they are not enough. Documentation, as an Information Product, also needs [Information Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture) and [Knowledge Management Practices](2022/01/05/personal-knowledge-mgmt/). These will guide documentation from 'producer-oriented' toward 'user-oriented'. If we do, then our documentation will be less 'surprising' and more 'delighting'.
