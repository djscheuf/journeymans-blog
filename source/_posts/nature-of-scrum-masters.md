description: I went back to the Scrum Guide while wondering about the role of a Scrum Master, and I discovered something surprising.

Not long ago, I found myself wondering about the proper role of a Scrum Master. What is their role on a team and within the organization as a whole? So naturally, I cracked open the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) for some answers. What I found surprised me. Per the Guide, the [Scrum Master](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master) serves many audiences. They serve the Team, the product owner, _and_ the organization. That last one particularly caught my attention. In several of my roles, I've worked with people called 'Agile Coaches', besides the Scrum Masters. The main difference I can see is that the Agile Coach _coaches_ the teams, including the Scrum Master. They aim at effectively applying agile principles. Further they train and coach the organization in it's agile transformation. But go back and read the Scrum Master section of the Guide right quick... 

The role of Scrum Master, as defined by the guide, actually appears to be one that floats between scopes. On one end, the team and basic application the Scrum framework. And on the other coaching and training the entire organization! Essentially there is an expected ebb and flow in the Scrum Master's work. They are there rolling out Scrum to the organization. Thus the effective Scrum Master appears at times to focus on the team and at others to play the role of the Agile Coach. Curious, that we should separate the role in practice, isn't it?
