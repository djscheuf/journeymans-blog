description: Disaster occurs when we find out too late that our organization hasn't the strength to pivot. How might discover this before we need our fullest capacity?

In the movie [Titanic](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/), around when the titular ship has hit the iceberg, one of the actors makes an insightful comment: "She was too much ship, with too little rudder." The crew of the ship didn't learn of this until a disaster demanded they use their fullest capacity. To be fair, it is very uncommon to test anything to its very limits in software or organizations. But it does leave a disquieting wonder... How can you tell if an organization is 'too much ship with too little rudder' before a disaster demands our fullest capacity?
