While reading [Agile Testing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321534468/), the authors included *'Demonstration'*, or [Sprint Demo](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-review), as a testing method. Demos can be used as Business-facing test to critique the product. Now, when you test a hypothesis, you are checking to see if the experimental results are in line with expectations. So what does a Demo need to make it a suitable test? **Questions!** A Demo allows us to validate the team's hypotheses around the new feature. Observe your users as they explore the feature. Ask questions on their experience, with a eye towards learning the user's needs, and their frame of mind. Then compare the user's feedback with the team's hypothesis. It will take some practice for you, your team, and your users to learn how to demo-test well. But frequent demos can be a great testing ground!
