I am pleased to announce the completion of a recent side-project. This side-project is also the reason for my hiatus over the last few months. I have been looking for a new blogging platform. 
I sought finer control of the site, and the satisfaction that comes with doing-it-yourself.

I found this happy medium in a static site generator called [Hexo](hexo.io). It took some time to find a generator I was comfortable with. Then it took time to actually transition my blog. And finally it took time to sort out hosting. All in all, I spent about a week actually doing code stuff. I spent the rest either researching generators, or finding [the right host](netlify.com).

To my delight, I have enough material to populate a blog series. If the topic interests you, I invite you to my new blog site: [daniel.scheufler.io](daniel.scheufler.io) for the rest of the series.

Until then, I would like to leave you with this blessing, in case we are here parting ways: '
May the road rise up to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine wamr upon your face;
the rain fall soft upon your fields
and until we meet again,
may God hold you in the palm of His hand. '
