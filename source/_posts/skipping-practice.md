Your Organization *probably* skipped practice. 

Any new behavior/process takes a few repetitions to learn. New Habits take 21 reps to sink in! But when was the last time you 'drilled' on any process? A new process only works when we follow it. We can only follow it, if we've learned it. And to learn, it takes repetition aka practice! Just remember, if you're playing the game, it isn't practice. 

Practice can slow-down. Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast. 
Practice can be redone. It's not the real-deal.  
Practice can simulate rare or hard events. That way, you've seen them before their real!

Review your processes. Write them down! Regularly Practice the important ones! And Make time to practice the new ones!
