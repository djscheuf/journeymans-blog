I was recently given a small notebook specifically for Commitments.  In it's small pages it has forms for Commitments, where you can list,  what the commitment is, who it is to, and when by. But the last line is the most impactful, whose initials are T.N.S. 

This  line is for 'Tiny Next Steps'. The idea being to build momentum. By  taking a small but concrete and meaningful next step, you get the commitment rolling. This one change in constructing a commitment  revolutionized commitments, especially those to self!

As an example, I've been meaning to set-up some consistent time to be with  my Father.  It's been scarce since I left the house. I had vague notions of setting up a Saturday morning breakfast with him, but didn't act on it last year. I kept telling myself I'd get to it.

Enter  the Commitment Journal. I added this commitment with some others and  then struck on the TNS line. I had to pause for a second to find  something I could do. And I realized that I should schedule a block of  time to call my Dad and plan this with him. So I wrote that as the TNS: Block off time to call Dad. 

What  was more fun is that about an hour later I had 15min to wait on  something. I was able to setup 30min to chat with my Father that day,  and I had a reminder on my phone so I'd remember to call. And I must  admit, getting to check-off that TNS was most satisfying. I know the moment I took to think on a concrete step made [the difference between motion and action](https://jamesclear.com/taking-action). 

My Dad and I now have a time on the Calendar and even a plan for where we shall dine. I am looking forward to building better commitments in the coming year, especially starting with this success. I heartily recommend  the Tiny Next Step formula! May it serve you well in the coming New  Year! Make SMART resolutions with Tiny Next Steps :D
