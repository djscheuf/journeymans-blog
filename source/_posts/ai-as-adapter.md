description: AI isn't smarter than you—it's an adapter that transforms your specialty time into average-level output in any other domain. The question is - what would you do with access to an infinite team of average specialists?

"We're nearing the point where AI is more intelligent than most people doing knowledge work." At least, that's the narrative. But framing it that way leads to very different behavior than what we actually need. If AI is smarter than you, the logical conclusion is automation and replacement. But what if we're asking the wrong question?

AI isn't smarter than you. It's an adapter. The "GPT" in ChatGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. It transforms one kind of input into another via statistical algorithm. It's a little like alchemy. Lead into Gold and all that. We trained their machines on all the publicly (and some not publicly) available information.  They are 'predicting' based on the 'average' of all that information.  So what these tools really do is transform time! They give everyone access to the average level of output from every other specialty. Imagine it! What you could do if you had access to an infinite team specialists all for cents on the dollar!?

This is the alchemy of time. You pour in your specialty time and transmute it into average-level output in any other domain you can describe. An engineer can transform some of their time into marketing time. A salesperson can transform theirs into software engineering time. AI adapts one specialty into another. But here's the trick: you have to describing it well. 

The new core skill isn't coding or design or analysis. It's clearly articulating your intent. What are you actually trying to achieve? Because AI excels at transformation tasks like summarization, analysis, and reframing. But the goal was never lines of code. It was never UX mockups. It was never any single output. The goal is a working solution.

This means effective empowerment looks different now. It's not just enabling decisions when you're not in the room. It's enabling output creation when the specialist isn't in the room. New tools demand new systems and new ways of thinking. As [John Boyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)) taught us: People, Process, Technology in that order.

[AI won't transform your business](/blog/ai-wont-transform/) Motivated people making clever use of it might. But only if they can answer: What would I do if I had access to an infinite team specialists? Until your knowledge workers can answer that competently, you won't see the benefits AI can produce. Until you can how your organization could support that output, you won't either!

The question isn't whether AI will replace us. The question is: How will you help your team imagine and then create what's possible?
