description: For a team to work, it must be able to Sense, Decide and Act. Could the minimal design for a team fractal outward and apply at the organization level?

Have you ever heard of the [OODA Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)? It is short for Observe-Orient-Decide-Act. I find the value-delivery loop interesting . You can apply it equally at the individual, team, and even organization levels! There are three necessary capacities: Sense, Decide and Act. At the team level, these three capacities are often separate specialties. For a Scrum Team, the Product Owner handles the team's Product Decisions. Likewise the developers enact those decisions. Lately I have begun to [see the same patterns at the organization level](https://videos.itrevolution.com/watch/467488959/). Almost like applying a [Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). The specialization is at higher levels of Sensing, Decision. While the composing teams serve as the Action arm. I begin to wonder whether an organization might truly be Fractal in nature. Might we grow an organizations out of the inherent specialization expressed in the Individual to Team step?
