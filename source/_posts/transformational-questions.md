description: A good question is worth a thousand answers... But what makes a question transformational?
---

A good question is worth a thousand answers. 
You can keep asking yourself again and again, and each time gain new insights. 
Agile and Lean Manufacturing are excellent examples of this kind of result. 
Agile stems from _"How can I provide more value?"_. 
Lean Manufacturing emerges from _"How can I continually do more and more with less and less?"_
Their principles and processes emerged as systematic answers. 
A transformational question first assumes that it is possible to answer. 
Then it challenges you to find the way! 
When I first read the Effective Executive, I found such a question. 
I've been asking myself this question almost daily since: _"What can I contribute?"_
These transformational questions ought to be shared, and widely and frequently! 
A good question is worth a thousand answers, and could change the world. 
What transformational questions do you have in your kit?
