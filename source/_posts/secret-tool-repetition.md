I was recently reminded of an under-appreciated leadership tool. What's more, it doesn't exactly feel like a tool in and of itself. The tool is _'Consistency'_, or repetition. This isn't a stand-alone tool, but rather one applied to augment many others. In fact, a little bit of repetition can go a long way.

Corporate catch-phases like _"Customer First"_, or _"Quality must be built in"_, are hollow. That is, until a leader puts their consistency behind those phrases in word and deed. Consistency is how you put time on your side. It's not glamorous, and often goes over-looked. But a little bit of repetition can go a long way.
