The very best teams plan how they play, and how they recover when things go wrong!

There are observable repeatable behaviors exhibited by High Performing teams, called [Behavioral Markers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25157188/)!
By documenting the behavioral markers you empower your teams and organization to mutually improve. 
This should include markers both the good times and during disruptions!
Check out [this set of Behavioral Markers](/mature-team-behaviors/), now including Disruption Behaviors!

Reach out to [Dan Walsh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danwalsh1115/) for more on [Scaling Agile Mindset with Behavioral Markers](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/scaling-an-agile-mindset-with-behavioral-marker-systems-2024-03pdf/266681348), from whom I first learned about Behavioral Markers!
I read about how a Toyota Factory handles work disruptions in [Wiring the Winning Organization](https://www.amazon.com/Wiring-Winning-Organization-Slowification-Simplification/dp/1950508420/), which sparked the expansion. 
For Disruptions, I advocate for the following behavioral markers:

## Recommended Behaviors
- For Every kind of Disruption:
		1. Finish WIP as much as you can (Flow Like Water), BEFORE diverting to any other Behavior ;  see also [Effectively Onboarding as a Junior Dev](../onboarding-junior-engineer/)
		2. Do NOT pick up NEW WIP!
		3. Review Disruption SOP (e.g. this list or similar)
		4. Start Monitoring Disruption Duration
- Activities by Disruption Duration (progress thru the List as Timer runs)
	- 0 - 15m - _Don't Lose Task Working-Memory_
		- Get up and Stretch
		- Clean your physical Workspace desk
		- Document your work (Comments, Documentation, Instrumentation)
	- 15 - 30m - _Stay within Task Zone, but expect Resumption Tax_
		- Add some Tests [Given-When-Then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given-When-Then) or similar post on testing. 
		- Review/Capture SOP (Your Supported Technologies, Team Working Agreement, Project Charter, [Ramp-up Dossier](https://youtube.com/shorts/nlRNc2YbwR4) etc.)
		- Install/Check for Dependency updates
	- 30 - 90m - _Resumption Tax unavoidable, can work further afield._
		- Inform Team/Leader of disruption, 
		- Defer to Leader's decision next actions (Swarm, Pivot, or Other)
		- Absent instruction:
			- Refactor per best practices, Upgrade core dependencies
			- Review Sprint Goal, and Action Items for this Sprint
			- Process/Self Improvement (Training, read a book, run an experiment)
	- Significant Disruption (e.g. 90m +) - _Work is stalled, prepare to swarm, or pivot_
		- Escalate Issue, start making noise, and get instruction/help from Ladders
		- Begin Swarming the problem with your Team if in your area
		- Or Pivot, per your Leader, to next-highest-value improvement
