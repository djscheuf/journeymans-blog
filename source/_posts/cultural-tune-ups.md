description: High-performance engines need periodic tuning and alignment. What might the equivalent be for High-performance teams?
---
High-performance engines need periodic tuning and alignment. Even the smallest misalignment can damage the engine itself! High-performing teams, like the engine, need periodic realignment too. They need occasional _'Cultural Tune-ups'_ if you will. Teams need to go back to basics. Back to why certain [actions](https://daniel.scheufler.io/2023/03/07/culture-reaction-to-behavior/), [habits](https://daniel.scheufler.io/2021/12/08/behaviors-build-culture/), or processes exist. And then diligently consider whether they are still serving the team. Is the team still aligned and pointed at their North Star? The industry landscape always changes, and so do people. When was the last time your team had a cultural tune-up?
