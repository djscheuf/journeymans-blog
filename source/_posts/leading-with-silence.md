description: Must a leader always answer? Or can silence be turned into an effective leadership tool?
---
What happens to a team if the leader is also its most effective contributor? If they are always the fastest to the answer? In such a case, the team may never get the chance to think through the problem themselves. They fail to develop the muscles to deliver that kind of value on their own. Part of leadership is helping the team learn to deliver that kind of results. In such a case, leadership can look like intentional silence, even when 'knowing' the answer. An awkward silence, effectively applied, can resound with learning opportunities.
