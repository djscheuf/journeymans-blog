I have discussed how [behaviors build culture](/2021/12/08/behaviors-build-culture/) before. But behaviors alone do not make a culture. 'Culture' encompasses the patterns, values, and _behaviors_ common to a group. Cultures are fundamentally about people and their interactions. So they can be difficult to measure. But you can identify what a culture values by how it treats certain behaviors.

What behaviors do you reward? People will repeat these.
What behaviors do you accept? These will become the standard.
What behaviors do you correct? People will avoid these.
And critically, how does your team treat the behaviors you are trying to encourage?
