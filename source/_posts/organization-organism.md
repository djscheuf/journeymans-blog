description: A department in an organization cannot feed itself, just as the hand or eye cannot thrive apart from the body. Yet the body seldom combats itself... What then might organizations learn from simpler organisms?

Can the software development department of your organization _'feed itself'_? Does your sales department also provide the goods or services you are selling? Unless your a small business/solopreneur, the answer is: no. These departments specialized in a specific kind of work. They only thrive when the organization as a whole does! You see this kind of specialization in biology too. Look at the members of your own body! The eye does not eat, the stomach does not see. Yet both only thrive while the body is healthy! We seldom see the members of the body combating with one another for resources. Instead these various members cooperate, and even specialize to reach greater goals. So to is it with a healthy organization. Organizations are a kind of meta-organism.
