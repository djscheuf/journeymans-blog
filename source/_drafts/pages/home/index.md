I am a Senior Consultant with Improving Houston. I have developed software for Oil and Gas, Tele-medicine and recently ECommerce clients. I work mostly in C#, but have recently added React and NodeJS to my toolbelt. Of late, I have begun to focus on the communication aspects of my work. It is a common gag in Industry that Developers don't speak the same language as 'normals'. I intend to bridge that gap. In an effort to capture my experience, and to help others I write a [blog](https://danieljscheufler.wordpress.com/blog/) with interesting discussions on development as a practice, as well as some nutz-and-bolts topics. Additionally I am developing talks on White-boarding, a feared Interview practice, which I happen to enjoy. If you are interested I can be reach on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielscheufler/), [Github](http://github.com/djscheuf), or via [email](mailto:daniel.j.scheufler@gmail.com) for speaking engagements, hackathons, pro bono work for nonprofits, or Lunch-and-Learns.
