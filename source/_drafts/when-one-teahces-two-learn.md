Ideas:

Start from WEbUI Testing Yes You Can talk. Go back a few months
Claudio and I working on same tema but Claudio Specializing in Backend and I was gorwing to Strength in Front End.

Then We run out of Backend stories so Claudio asks to Pair so he can learn this React Stuff. I am working on a Thunk for some Api calls and wanting to extend it.

He insists we start with the tests, which I admit I had little experience with, and had been favoring an AAA style with Jest. Plus testing Thunks is hard.

With his determiniation and insistence we set up reasonable pace to look at, describe and of course refactor the existing code so we could _prove_ it worked as expected.

Once we did that we could extend the functionality with the additional case. Which honestly went much faster now that our understanding of the code was stronger!. As it stood learning to test the Thunk improved the design of our code and encouraged us naturally to better patterns, and more discrete and testable units usually were also better defined and understood. Little to no hand-waving required.

While we were talking about the test I was able to explain some of the juggling the React and Redux were doing that allowed use to get the information we needed into the thunk. I was also able to explain some of the JS idiosyncracies that were used to make test writting easier.

That is Testing provided ample opp to teach concepts.
