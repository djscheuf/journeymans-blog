Claudio and I had worked together for a number of months on the same team together. We'd worked on several projects. And on numerous occassons I was blessed to work with him in C#, and area he excels in. 

Moreover I learned a great deal under his tutalage especially in how to Test and design using Tests. Then one fateful day, that all flipped on its head.

WE were working on a heavy UI project and Claudio wanted/needed to learn React. I had become among the team's top contribitors of UI code. Since we already knew we paired well, we decided to do so again. 

Here we had an interesting twist though. Claudio wasn't teach this time, I was. Though we definitely started with the Testing side by his choice, the content of what we did and discussed came from me. 

During this time I had to learn several new tricks. Where before I was able to reast easy and merely ask questions, now I had to find way to help him learn what I had come to grasp about the How and the flow of a React App. In learning to do this I naturally practiced some patience, but more usefully I had to learn to construct meaningufl explanations for things I might intuitively know. That is I had to verbalize a gut feeling.

Thankfully, Claudio, being very experienced in these activities was able to help teach me how to do taht as well. And of course his long-suffering patience was impressive, as I had to practice listening to really get what he was asking about.

Moreover I had to learn the right way _and_ the right time to explain the answers to his questions. Several times I had to stop myself to providing a full explanation because for the purpose of the code we were looking at, the extra information would make it more confusing. 

Through all of this, I found that rather than diminish my respect for Claudio, it deepend. He was willing to admit when he did not know and was interested to learn. I will remember his example and endeavor to follow it in the future, when I find myself in a similar position.
