I recently read an article posted on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-talk-developer-part-1-jacob-silva/), discussing the idea that _'Developers are bad communicators'._ I encourage you to read it through before continuing. Personally, I opened the article prepared to defend the poor developer against a needless accusation. I was pleasantly surprised , that it was wholly unnecessary. Further I found the authors discussion to be quite observant. He cut straight to the heart of the issue. In his example, a manager had come to ask why it was going to take so long for _just a website._ On the face, that is a reasonable question., though it hides a certain venom. Think for a moment, if someone came to you and ask why your work took any time at all? Just because they don't understand doesn't mean that they should be so unkind as to insinuate that you are wasting their time. And what's scary is just how easy it is to make this mistake. We do it all the time.
