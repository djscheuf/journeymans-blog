\# NOT READY TO PUBLISH The general idea of this post is to be a parrallel on LinkedIn Publishing. It is intended to be in 3 parts:

1.  Alchemist (A Humorous beginning) - This title needs work, because it doesn't fit very well
    1.  Shortly, we take component parts and create something new and greater from them. We are craftsmen, and tinkerers. For many it is a labor of love, for others it is an art. But the basic principles remain the same. And as with all practices some patterns emerge, if only we would listen.
2.  Translator - This was the original point of the idea, so may be moved to point 3
    1.  We are translators. We speak both a human language, and the language of machines. We are familiar with the intricacies of both, and the best of us know how to speak to each in such a way as to be represent the others ideas and limitations.
3.  Human
    1.  The best manager knows his people. And Software engineer are, while peculiar, very human. though we work on a team, each member is still strongly influenced by their preferences. You can see it in coding styles, and in the manner in which they take and look at certain assignments. We as engineers need to remember this, because, while we might prefer one way and understand one way, our colleagues will not necessarily share those views. The best among us ( not simply the lonely expert) need to have some charisma to help explain and convince others to their side.
