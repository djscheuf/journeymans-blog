--Synopsis only not ready to post! \[A\] Intro \[B\] Framing: Discuss Yagni As I have been working at a Software Engineer, one term come up time and again during code reviews. YAGNI. It is usually said when I have tried to solve a problem that isn't in the system yet, but could be in the future. YAGNI stands for "You aren't gonna need it". And generally serves as a reminder to be pragmatic about what you do and do not code. After all, you might not need that extra bit of code later. This is in essence seeking to be Pragmatic about the code that one develops. Now, just like any phrase which represents a principle, it can be misapplied and abused. However, I find YAGNI to be, on the whole, effective and helpful. But recently while I was ruminating on the principle behind it, I realized that one of the pillars of the AGILE methodology is also an extension! \[C\] Discuss Minimum viable Product In AGILE, there is a concept called the 'Minimum Viable Product'. It has many different explanations, and understandings, but the one which I ascribe to, is this. The Minimum viable product is the version of the product which completed the bare essentials of a workflow, without bells, whistles, or trimming, that can be given to the customer to acquire feedback on the experience and on the efficacy, with the least effort possible. In shorter terms, it is the version that does the job, but not much else, and may not even be very pretty. The Minimum Viable Product, hereafter MVP, is intended to prevent the Developers from entering the "It's not ready yet" cycle, where new features and trimming are continually added, without meaningful feedback from the customers. It is supposed to ensure that new software products, or even new features get the vital User input they need while still in their infancy, rather than waiting until vast labyrinths of architecture have grown up around the core product. Which if you think about it is a very pragmatic approach. Think of it this way, group A constructs a grand town-car. It has nice soft seats, and good gas mileage. What more could a customer ask for? while group B, who got their baseÂ product out faster, found out that the customer didn't care much about gas efficiency, but rather needed a load bearing vehicle for mud and snow. Of course, Group B probably only delivered a chassis, steering wheel, and driver seat. But which of the groups do you think is in a better position? Group A might have changed the material their chassis was made from to improve their gas mileage, resulting in a chassis that isn't strong enough to support the loads that the customer wants to carry. Neither group was able to meet all the customer's needs in their first draft, but Group A may have to undo many months of work in order to reach the same point as group B starts at. All group B might have to do is pick up the driver seat and steering wheel and move it to a stronger chassis. Overall a much better position. Of course, you'll notice that Group A had a much higher potential of lost work, due to their choice of when to deliver. This is why I think YAGNI and MVP are really cut from the same cloth. \[D\] Pivot : Wither Technology ( example of Nintendo Gameboy and the Atari Lnyx) \[E\] Ask the questions: What is the purpose of software? Is it more important to be "Whiz-bang" or to be exceptionally functional on an older technology? Discuss mildly about VR
