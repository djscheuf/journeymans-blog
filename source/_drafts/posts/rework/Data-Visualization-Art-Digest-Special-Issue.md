A Journeyman's Digest special issue on Data Visualization Art. Should specifically mention TED talk, and the Physics sound track Alchemy. Should discuss some ideas like:

*   Heart Beat data symphony
*   Code Base Symphony, or day-to-day growth visualization ( or both)
*   Tree model of Person-of-interests life, people them met, things they did, or the like.
*   Github code base map, linking contributors and locations? (if that info is available), like building towers per 1000 lines of code

Translating our data into another ‘visualization’ so that we can see different aspects. And of course the necessary weaknesses of the correlations. Yey statistics!
