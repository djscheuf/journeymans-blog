I did a thing! I migrated to Hexo SSG :D

So I've been bugged by Wordpress for a while. Plenty of features,a bit slow, and steadily getting more annoying as it asks for more and more. Can't say 200% why I got miffed, but I did and now I am on my own :D

I started by tinkering with Hexo and Heroku. I am hosting this blog based on a Github Repo, which is then hosted by Heroku. Since this whole thing is an npm package, I simply set up the start script to run the hexo server, and viola! a site is served.

Now admittedly the initial theem is abit boring, so I jumped to BeanTech. Which I personally think is rather nice. And then as is my wont, I tweaked it. The BeanTech guy had a thing for Ironman (speaking of which his art was quite good :) ), however I didn't feel the Ironman theme worked as well for me so I returned several styles to the original style. And I removed numerous other unecessary acctrema.

Then I turned to my old site. I had no wish to manually migrate all the posts as I had done with my three tests posts. To my great delight hexo has a plugin just for that. More over they included insturtion on their site for how to get started. I downloaded my blog xml from wordpress, and ran the migrator. While some of the draft pages didn't tranlate super well the rest of the posts and pages converted nicely. Thank you wordpress for not preventing me from claiming my content. I am truly grateful.

Once my blog was migrated, all I had to do was some clean-up work, which in the hexo format was pleasantly easy :).
