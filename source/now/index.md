## Yearly Planning
Rounding the bend on the last month of the year, I have spent the last couple weeks reviewing and pondering last year's planning mechanisms. Some worked, some didn't. So naturally I am planning to pivot. Last year's plan was mostly a bunch of I want to Do X, selected at the beginning of the year, lumped into categories. Good news is that those that mattered, got done, and earlier than usual in the year, thru Q1 and Q2. But I felt like I lost steam in Q3. So next year, I am pivotting away from a list of 'Do X' towards a set of 'Be Y-er' type goals, to serve as a decision making guide, so that each Quarter, I can select from those to make a discrete 'Do X' type improvement on. 

## Client Work
I started the year with a different client than I am working with now. And I feel like I have just recently started getting my bearings at this client. It is a much wider reaching goal than previous, so it will serve as an excellent challenge and application of some of the skills I have and some I am still developing. Moreover, I am getting to work with a good team, lead by a User Group Leader I had met and worked with in years prior. (Hint: See NHDNUG). 

All in all, the role started as leading up Front End Development efforts across several times using React and Typescript. And has since morphed into stewarding overall Process Quality, taking a lead role in QA, Automation, Front End Dev, and even some efforts in the agile transformation. It has been great fun! Among the new things I am learning, I am getting exposure to the realm of Data Science and Engineering and gaining a new found respect for the fields. I look forward to more growth in the area in the future, especially as we being to operationalize some of the products!

## Reading
One of my goals for the year was to significantly increase my reading. And I have made good headway there. Both in pleasure and development reading I have success! Recently I have been reading:
- [The Gifts of Imperfection](https://brenebrown.com/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection/) by Brene Brown
- [Agile Conversations](https://agileconversations.com/) by Douglass Squirrel and Jeffrey Fredrick

The Gifts book was rather challenging emotionally, but provides some much needed framework and language for processing some of the frustrations I have experienced this year. As a result of my current reading, I have gained the language to have several deeper and more intimate conversations with my wife, as well as own some of my experiences more fully. I feel more whole, and less need to hide or perfect. It really is a relief.

As for Agile Conversations, the book has been a BIG help to me. The core idea of the book is that most 'Agile Transformations' fail due to a lack of the organizational culture changing. You can paint on practices all day and hang any posters you want, but for an organization to change the people in it must change. The book highlights some fo the symptoms of surface level only changes, and offers numerous tools for self-reflection to help you improve the primary mechanism by which we can help people change: conversation. With my current client attempting such a transformation it has been incredibly helpful. Moreover, one of the ideas was so impactful to me that I am expandning on it for a Lunch and Learn coming soon!

On the pleasure front, I have recently been enjoying entries from the Ember Wars by Richard Fox. I most recently chewed through his Terran Armor Corp series. So if you're interested in a SciFi Military Thriller, it might be up your alley.

## What's next?
My goal at present is to bring the last month of 2021 to a smooth landing. I'm hoping to arm 2022Q1 planning more effectively based on my retrospectives for 2021. I'll be onboarding a new FrontEnd Developer for my client thru December and I am eager to get started. Finally I will be polishing [several talks for delivery in Early January, at THAT Conference!](/2021/11/22/that-conf-jan-2022/) Hope to see you there!
