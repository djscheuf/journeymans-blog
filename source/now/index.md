## Quarterly Planning
This quarter is going to be a bit of a wild ride. I am still favoring more of the 'Be X' type goals, but the events coming up this quarter will be heavily impacting what will get done. 

First and foremost of those events, is the immiment arrival of twins for my wife and I. I expect to be taking considerable Paternity leave towards the middle of this year. So almost all of my work this quarter is done with the end of enabling the organizations and capacities I serve to continue while I go dark for a bit. 

Along that vein, I am working to deepen several of the mentoring relationships I have been graced to have. I am working to become more intentional in how I approach those conversations, in the hopes that I can help provide better value for the time spent, by doing so. 

Lastly, I am making a concerted effort to cultivate 'restorative action'. I'll be writing on those in the near future. But suffice to say that I am working to apply some realizations I have had about what it takes to maintain a cadence of excellence.

## Client Work
On the client front, we just finished an Innovation and Planning sprint. So I am spending considerable time helping to land the threads from those efforts as we go. In addition to that, I have been helping the Director to redesign some of the organization workflows to enable better flow of value and move us towards the culture he envisions. 

## Reading
More and more books! I had the chance to read a fair few books lately, including finishing Antifragile. I am particularly keen on [Team Topologies](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819), which has proven almost immediately useful. Through that book I have gained a vocabulary which has allowed me to more effectively convey several observations and highlight several opportunities in my present work. I even found out recently that the authors are publishing a [Remote Team Interactions Workbook](https://itrevolution.com/remote-team-interactions-workbook/) later this month specifically around virtual teams. I bought it on pre-order and found it likewise insightful.

## What's next?
Looking ahead, I am looking to help set a couple initiatives in Improving on a stable course through Q2. I have a number of conference talks coming up in May, with THAT Conference. And I'm hoping I can get some time to settle in with a good book somewhere in there too!
