## Happening Now

### Improving Talks
I've spent this year focusing deeply on Improving Talks, the weekly, virtual, thought leader lunch and learn put on by Improving. I've found numerous areas for improvement, but among the experiments I have been most pleased with has been the development of series. The first of these experiments ran in March, honing all 5 of the talks that month on a single subject area. At the time of writing, the second iteration of this experiment will be just about to conclude. I am eager to see the results, and to continue experimentation. If you have any feedback, or perhaps topics you'd like to see covered, just reach out and tag me at [daniel dot scheufler at improving dot com](mailto:daniel.scheufler@improving.com)!

### My Talks Page
One of my favorite ways to contribute to the community, is though Public Speaking. I've delivered numerous topics, on numerous subjects, even virtually during COVID. Though nothing quite matched the feeling of engaging with a live audience. That said, I am planning to build up a public list of Talks hosted on this side. I'll keep the v1 of the list short for now, focusing on those talks which have proven durable, or are in the subject areas I specifically want to focus in. Keep an eye out for future updates on [My Talks](/talks) page for new future entries!

### Good Reading

I've been blessed to find several good books this year. At the moment, I am thoroughly enjoying a re-read of [The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/B015YMLYGM/) by Drucker, as I prepare for the next Podcast Season. Be sure to [keep an eye out](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/journeymans-travels) for the trailer in the near future! But I'd also recommend taking a look at [Help Them Grow or Watch Them Go](https://www.amazon.com/Help-Them-Grow-Watch-Conversations/dp/1523097507/)! The new way of looking at career conversations, and some of the tools discussed have been great!

## Happening Soon

### Retiring the Comment System
A while back, I ran a series on how I went about selecting a comment system. I still stand by the process I used, but I am finding that the comment system sees far less use than I had hoped. And being the financier, far less use that I am wish to purchase at its current price. So in the near future, likely by the end of September, I will be removing the Hyvor Talks comment system from a Journeyman's Travels. I have not yet decided what I'll be replacing it with, but I would be open to suggestions.  If you have an opinion, or an option you think I should consider, tag me at [daniel at scheufler dot io](mailto:daniel@scheufler.io).
