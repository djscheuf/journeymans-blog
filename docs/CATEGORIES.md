# Blog Post Categories

**Generated on:** 2026-01-12

## Purpose

This document defines the approved categories for blog posts. Each post should be assigned to **one primary category** that best represents the main focus of the content. Categories help organize content and guide readers to related topics within your blog's focus areas: Software, Engineering, and Leadership.

## Category Selection Guidelines

- Choose the **single category** that best represents the primary focus of the post
- Categories are broader than tags - they represent the main domain of the content
- When a post spans multiple categories, choose based on the primary audience or main takeaway
- Use the category definitions below to guide your selection

## Analysis Notes

Based on analysis of 84 posts published since 2023:

**Content Distribution Patterns:**
- **Leadership** posts typically focus on principles, people development, organizational culture, and working through others
- **Engineering** posts typically focus on agile practices, testing, technical processes, and how teams deliver software
- **Software** posts typically focus on business strategy, technology adoption, organizational design, and software's business role

**Key Insight:** Many posts touch multiple domains. The category should reflect the **primary lens** through which the content is presented, not every topic mentioned.

**Historical Categories:** Previous posts used categories like "Professional Development," "Software Development," "Personal Development," "Cybersecurity," "Architecture," "Facilitation," "Podcast," "Best Practices," "Tools," "Lessons Learned," and "Quality." These have been consolidated into the three primary categories above to better reflect the blog's core focus areas.

- **Rationale:** While it mentions Product Owners (agile role), the primary focus is on executive skills and working through others - core leadership capabilities

**Example 2:** "Demo as Test"
- **Category:** Engineering
- **Rationale:** Focuses on testing practices and how to use Sprint Demos as a testing method - engineering practice

**Example 3:** "AI Won't Transform Your Business"
- **Category:** Software
- **Rationale:** Focuses on technology adoption and business transformation - software's role in business strategy

**Example 4:** "Organization as Organism"
- **Category:** Leadership

## Maintenance

**Review Frequency:** Annually or when content focus shifts significantly

**When to Reconsider Categories:**
- Blog focus expands beyond Software, Engineering, and Leadership
- Reader feedback indicates confusion about category organization
- Significant shift in content distribution across categories
- New major content theme emerges that doesn't fit existing categories

## Notes

- This categorization scheme was created on 2026-01-12 based on analysis of 84 posts since 2023
- The three categories align with the blog's stated focus: Software, Engineering, and Leadership
- Each post should have exactly one category to maintain clear organization
- Tags (see `TAGS.md`) provide additional topical connections across categories
