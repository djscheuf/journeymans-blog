      Hello there! My name is Daniel Scheufler. I am a Principal Consultant with Improving Houston where I have developed software for oil and gas, telemedicine, eCommerce, and legal clients. I work mostly in the .NET Stack with React/Typescript but continue to add new languages and frameworks to my toolbelt. Of late, I have honed my focus on Software Engineering Leadership, and on the communciation aspect of my work. Everything rises and falls on leadership. Communication is just part of that skill set.

I have developed <a href="/talks">numerous community talks</a> on a variety of topics, covering leadership, agility, and effectiveness to name a few. Want to get to know me better?
