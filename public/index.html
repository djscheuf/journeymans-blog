        <p>Have you seen the <a href="https://github.audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project audio for Github</a>? Or the plethora of esoteric languages like <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piet</a> or <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&gt;&lt;&gt;</a> (pronounced: fish)? Recently I had a ‘coding challenge’ for fun at work. The challenge was to print a poem in a language we didn’t already know. In that time I’ve picked up four such languages, which got me thinking. We, developers, enjoy some of this artsy kind of stuff. Sure it’s not your typical artwork, except for Piet. But it is very creative at heart. Then the light-bulb lit up, Software Developers are members of the ‘Creatives’ community.</p>
<p>To be clearer, ‘Creatives’ is the group of designers, and artists who contribute to projects in more media-centric ways. For example, the icons, the color scheme, or the marketing campaigns and slogans all fit the bill. Software Engineers are usually inclined to disdain the ‘Creatives’. This is because it is harder to measure what creatives actually do. But I suspect there are some lessons we can learn, if we would open our eyes.</p>
<p>Generally, one manages ‘Creatives’ in a particular way. The method enables the creative freedom. It also establishes the safe environment needed to ‘try something new’. This allows them to bring their brilliance to any given project. This environment makes sense for the product they deliver. If a creative team does not feel safe, very few ideas appear, leading to lack of success. Of course, such an environment is difficult to setup and very easy to tear down. One cruel word, or breach of trust and the system comes toppling down.</p>
<p>In contrast, many software development teams are more hierarchical in their style. Additionally, there tend to be more men than women. As a result, software teams tend to favor codified leadership. We like increased authority rather than community, at least in traditional corporations. Most design ‘discussions’ are arguments in fancy dress. And sometimes this can work well, since engineers usually like to debate. But we should consider adopting some strategies from the ‘creatives’ side.</p>
<p>A safe environment with respectful discussion rather than debate could be desirable. This environment would allow us to foster new and brilliant solutions. In order for this to work, software developers would have to realize they are ‘creatives’ too. We would have to change our ‘comfortable’ behavior to allow for a better team environment. This, of course, comes down to culture, but also to maturity. We must be mature enough to admit we might have missed something. And we must be mature enough to want the best ideas, rather than our own.</p>
<p>At a manager’s level, if Software engineers are creative, then we ought to manage them differently. Dictating the chapter and verse of a solution you want is unproductive. It limits the benefit you can gain from your brilliant engineers. Instead, we need to challenge them. Provide them a problem and your rough idea of a solution and then encourage improvement upon it. Don’t dictate your needs as you would to your digital assistant. Rather begin a discussion about the best way forward. Before committing to deadlines, allow for ideas to circulate and then commit. Who knows, maybe we can learn something from those crazy ‘creatives’ in the east wing after all?</p>

        <p>‘Roll Initiative!’ – A common call to arms in Dungeons and Dragons. I will freely admit; I still play on occasion with some of my college buddies. But this week during some quiet reflection a strange idea dawned on me. You could use DnD to practice a different forms of leadership.</p>
<p>Now of course, pretending to be someone else is part and parcel for role-playing in general. But I specifically thought in terms of business. If you do a quick search for Software Development managers, you can find a variety of ideas on the topic. These include books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Second/dp/0932633439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peopleware</a>. There are also in-depth discussions on topics such as ‘Sovereign Software Development’[<a href="https://top.fse.guru/the-civilized-alternative-to-agile-tribalism-4c60d01428c0#.3m4tg0ivh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@bryanedds/an-unexpected-inquisition-c4776bdedbb8#.ayu1jea40" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>]. Nearly all mention the short-comings of management practices. Nearly all offer various ways around it. One weakness that I’ve found mentioned a handful of times is the way in which a manager leads their team.</p>
<p>In a standard manager-employee relationship, the manager has authority through their title. This authority allows them to direct employees. This template can be made more complex with additional layers, or by cross-reporting to different people; all of which serve to confuse the issue and can lead to other troubles. Other models exist and the community likes discussing them. Many follow the pattern of servant leadership. Here the manager governs not by title-given authority. Instead managers govern by consensus, or by authority awarded them by the people they serve. Both of these increase the autonomy of the developers relative to their managers.</p>
<p>But that very idea can be daunting and even frightening to a manager used to the traditional role. And this is where DnD comes in. I’ve seen several situations in which a player’s out-of-game personality bleeds into their character. It can be quite a trick to wholly separate your thoughts from your characters. But in this case, that blurred line could be useful. If a manager encountered a mock-leadership situation, they could practice their methods. DnD offers an excellent environment for this activity.</p>
<p>To take a personal example, I wind up being the de facto leader in my player group. Generally, I will suggest an idea for our group, and ask for input. And usually the group says, ‘Sounds good.’ And that is that. Lately, I’ve been worried that I am unintentionally killing their creativity by proposing my own solution rapidly after being presented the challenge. I plan to try ask for input first this time. I can then propose my ideas as a modification to the ideas. I will try this next game and see if the results are more enjoyable for all of us.</p>
<p>By taking a bit of the real-world within me into the game I can see how I could take a bit of the game back into the real world. Just because it is a game, doesn’t mean the lessons we learn in it are inapplicable to our work in the real world. Perhaps it’s time to roll some dice?</p>

        <p>At first glance, this would seem an obvious statement. And it is in a way. When Python language creator Guido Van Rossum created Python, he did so with this thought in mind. As a result, the culture of Python is partly molded around <em>“readability counts”</em>.</p>
<p>The more I thought that statement, the more I realized the marvel it held. <em>‘Code is read more often than it is written’</em>. If asked to choose between reading and writing, I would have said the same. And yet I realized now, that much of the code I have read, and some of the code I have written does not show this. I wondered, why did my behavior, and that of my peers, not match what I knew to be true? If we believed that code was read more often, they why is so much of our code so hard to read?</p>
<p>At the core, our behavior remains unchanged because this quote is only an observation. There is not imperative contained in it. Without the means of an imperative, the observation cannot turn into an action. Instead the reader would need to derive <em>‘Code ought to be easily read’</em> from <em>‘Code is read more often than it is written’</em>. I trust most would be equal to the task, given a basic desire to optimize.</p>
<p>When I first discovered this, I did not pay it nearly enough attention. I went blithely on my way. Some time later, during the quiet of a vacation, the thought came storming back. I was left dumbfounded. How could I have not seen it earlier? I realize now, it was because I had not given my self enough time to think. With the lighter load during vacation, I was able to think, and so naturally the thought came.</p>
<p>This moment of serendipity also encouraged other considerations. Specifically, what other imperatives had I missed with casual observations? I quickly realized this is dark territory. It would be difficult to turn every observation into a possible imperative. Worse still, these observations might be biases, leading to bad imperatives. Or they might be too weak to lead to a meaningful imperative.</p>
<p>In all cases, the question remains, what have I missed? I believe, especially in software, that we are caught in a rush to develop, to implement, and to finish. As a result, we do not give ourselves time to ask, <em>‘Is this the best way?’</em> Business demands that we move with purpose, and that is a reasonable demand. But for the best results, we need time to consider if we go in a way that will deliver us to the goal we seek. I will continue to look for miss-able observations may turn out to change everything.</p>
<p>Addendum:</p>
<p>While drafting this article, two other examples of <em>‘observation leading to imperative’</em> appeared. The first was fictional, from <strong>Foundation and Earth</strong> by Isaac Asimov. In the book, the protagonist remarks with surprise at the neural interface to a computer. Instead of being an over-the-head affair, it was through the hands. His realization was that humans sense and interact with the world through their hands. I may revisit this in a later branch of this discussion on design.</p>
<p>The second example, sprouted from the first, specifically interaction and design. Recently the IoT movement has brought integration to our homes. In particular, the voice-interaction, such as Amazon’s Echo or Google Now. I observed that these devices extended a natural principle: <em>‘Humans use their voice to make their wishes known.’</em></p>
